Module 1 Challenge for Vanderbilt Data Analytics September 2023
# Content

The four files located in this repository are as follows:

1. This README text file.
2. The Crowdfunding Book spreadsheet.
3. The Module 1 Challenge report document.
4. A Statistical Analysis pdf that is a snapshot of the Statistical Analysis sheet in the original Crowdfunding Book spreadsheet: Due to the infamous unreliability of MS Excel worksheet markups, this was included as a backup to demonstrate where the notes were originally intended to appear.

# Special Recognition: 

I did participate in various study groups while working on this project. My collaborators included but were not necessarily limited to the following peers:

A Reed
Andrew Clifft
Forest Prodan
Ilknur Sekmen
Josh Gibson
Justin Ibeh
Karson Kosek
Kiara Shannon
Luisa Dinwiddie
Margo Berry
Maria Wolfgang
Morgan Escue
Morgan Foge
Nathan Johnson
William Brewer

The three peers whom I recall providing me with the most feedback and insight were Josh Gibson, Margo Berry, and Morgan Escue; however, I think you'll find we did not all agree about every single aspect of either our methods or findings. I am grateful to my collegues and eager to work together as a team, but every part of this project represents my personal work, and nothing has been lifted from a peer.
